## O1 - workshop and elixir introduction

1) __A quick intro about the workshop:__

> The workshop main goal is to do a quick introduction to the elixir language, phoenix and OTP framework.

> My personal goal is to not make one more rails port elixir tutorial for you, but to show some of the more important differnences, which are made possible by the language design itself and the functional paradigm.

> Generally the application we will create will be a quite trivial one, but don't be afraid it will not be one more TODO list. We will fetch the lattest posts from same of the selected subreddits.
